## üìå Open Source Agreement

![LGPL v3](docs/img/lgplv3-147x51.png)

**Soft work number**: `2020SR0411603`

### üìÑ Agreement explanation

LGPL ([GNU Lesser General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html))

LGPL is an open source agreement of GPL designed mainly for the use of class libraries. It is different from the GPL requirement that any software that uses/modifies/derives the GPL library must adopt the GPL agreement. LGPL allows commercial software to use LGPL class libraries through class library links without the need for open source commercial software codes. This allows the open source code that adopts the LGPL agreement to be referenced, published and sold by commercial software as a class library. 

However, if the code of the LGPL agreement is modified or derived, all the modified code, the additional code involving the modified part and the derived code must adopt the LGPL agreement. Therefore, the open source code of the LGPL agreement is very suitable as a third-party class library to be cited by commercial software, but it is not suitable for commercial software that hopes to use the LGPL agreement code as the basis for secondary development through modification and derivation.

### ‚úÖ User rights

It is allowed to be used for learning, completion, company projects, private work, etc. for free in the form of introducing the source code without changing it.

Modify the code in special circumstances, but still want to close the source requires the author's consent.

For not authorized and do not follow the LGPL open source or secondary commercialization, we will pursue in the end.

Please note for reference: reference from mica: https://github.com/lets-mica/mica, please also follow the LGPL agreement.

`Note`: If the prohibition clause is discovered, it has the right to recover the authorization fee of **19999**.
