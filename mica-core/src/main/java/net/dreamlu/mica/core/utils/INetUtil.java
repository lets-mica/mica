	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Returns an <code>InetAddress</code> object encapsulating what is most likely the machine's LAN IP address.
	 * <p/>
	 * This method is intended for use as a replacement of JDK method <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost</code>, because
	 * that method is ambiguous on Linux systems. Linux systems enumerate the loopback network interface the same
	 * way as regular LAN network interfaces, but the JDK <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost</code> method does not
	 * specify the algorithm used to select the address returned under such circumstances, and will often return the
	 * loopback address, which is not valid for network communication. Details
	 * <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4665037">here</a>.
	 * <p/>
	 * This method will scan all IP addresses on all network interfaces on the host machine to determine the IP address
	 * most likely to be the machine's LAN address. If the machine has multiple IP addresses, this method will prefer
	 * a site-local IP address (e.g. 192.168.x.x or 10.10.x.x, usually IPv4) if the machine has one (and will return the
	 * first site-local address if the machine has more than one), but if the machine does not hold a site-local
	 * address, this method will return simply the first non-loopback address found (IPv4 or IPv6).
	 * <p/>
	 * If this method cannot find a non-loopback address using this selection algorithm, it will fall back to
	 * calling and returning the result of JDK method <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost</code>.
	 * <p/>
	 *
	 * @throws UnknownHostException If the LAN address of the machine cannot be found.
